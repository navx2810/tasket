h1. Tasket

Tasket is a kanban application similar to "Trello":http://trello.com.

h2. Preface

I am creating this application, because I feel that there are many kanban applications that either oversimplify or overcomplicate the problems they are trying to solve.

This project is to be used by any creator who wants to keep a heirarachical task-list that can be filtered and accessed by solo creators or groups of creators.

In Trello, I had the issue of combining sub-lists withing sub-lists. I would have to create new lanes and somehow logcially connect them so any reader could make sense of the havoc.

h2. Features

- Intuitive project-based hierarchy := Tasks contain parents and if a parent has two or more tasks, it's considered a project.
- User control and collaboration := Users can choose to "take on" tasks. Their name will appear in the task contributors list and any comments or updates will be linked and they will be notified.
- Mobile-first design := The application will keep mobile devices in mind so you can access the application from a phone, tablet, desktop, or web interface.

h3. Stretch-goal features

- Offline Save Data := The application can be used offline and when the user connects to a network, the changes will sync with the server.

h2. Technology

- "Vue.js":http://vuejs.org := a front-end library to assist in creating user-interfaces.
- "Webpack":https://webpack.github.io/ := a utility for building code into a single distributable file for web.
- "Babel":https://babeljs.io/ := a *transpiler* which accepts ES6 syntax and translates to ES5 code for full browser support.
- "NeDB":https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb := a subset from MongoDB which allows you to use persistent or in-memory storage options.
- "TypeScript":https://www.typescriptlang.org/ := similar to Babel, TypeScript is a microsoft-created project which adds types to ES6 syntax. Widely support by many IDE/Editors and has great development support.
- "NodeJS":https://nodejs.org := the back-end language used by the server/electron application.
- "Koa.JS":http://koajs.com/ := the lightweight server library that will be used for creating a RESTful microservice.

h3. Considered Technology

- "Feathers":http://feathersjs.com/ := a back-end server framework for real-time APIs. Includes SocketIO. Would replace KoaJS.
- "Socket.IO":https://socket.io/ := a real-time socket library. Works with Koa.JS and is included with Feathers.
