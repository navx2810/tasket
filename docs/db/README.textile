h1. Database

h2. Structure

The database will be accessed by a *db* interface. This will allow for several types of database connections. While most apps have their db calls inside their models, I chose to keep it all under one object. If the complexity grows, it might be worth a look to consider moving CRUD functionality into the models themselves, but this simplifies things for now.

h2. DB

This interface is how our connectors will recieve and push data to the server.

- Connect := connects to the database.
- AllEntities := retrieves all entities from the database.
- AllTasks := retrieves all tasks from the database.
- AllProjects := retrieves all projects from the database.
- FindEntity(entity_object) := retrieves the entities that match the *entity_object* template.
- CreateEntity(entity) := creates the entity and pushes it into the database.
- CreateContent(content) := creates the content and pushes it into the database.

h2. AppDB

This connector will store the database on the hard-disk. Only useable if on the *desktop* _(electron)_ version.

- Connect := opens the _"mydb.db"_ file to open the database.

h2. BrowserDB

This connector will store the database in-memory.

- Connect := creates a new db object with the option of in-memory.

h2. ServerDB

This connector will use an external server as it's database.

- Connect := requests a ping from the server registered in order to determine if a connection can be made.
